# Day 6

### Hello peeps! Welcome to Day 6 - Binary Trees and BST

> What we learn today?

1. Binary Trees:

-   A binary tree is a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).
-   Terminology: Root, leaf, depth, height, etc.
-   Types of Binary Trees:
    -   Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
    -   Complete Binary Tree: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last level.
    -   Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at the same level.
    -   Balanced Binary Tree: Ensures the height of the tree is minimized.

2. Binary Search Trees (BSTs):

-   A binary tree with the property that each node's left child is less than the node, and each right child is greater.
-   Operations: Insert, search, delete.
-   Applications: Efficient searching, range queries, and ordered data storage.

3. Practice Questions:

-   Given a binary tree, find its height.
-   Implement a binary search tree with operations: insertion, search, and deletion.
-   Implement a binary tree and perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.
-   Check if a given binary tree is a binary search tree.
-   Given a binary tree, print all nodes at a given depth.
