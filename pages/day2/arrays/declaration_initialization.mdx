# Declaration and Initialization

Before we can use an array, we need to declare and initialize it. The syntax varies slightly between programming languages, but the underlying concept remains the same: reserving a block of memory for our data.

<Callout type="info">
    Remember: In languages like C++ and Java, arrays have a fixed size once
    declared. In Python (Lists) and JavaScript, they are dynamic and can grow or
    shrink.
</Callout>

## How to Declare an Array

Declaring an array tells the compiler or interpreter that we want to create an array variable.

    In C++, we specify the type of elements and the name of the array. The size is often required for static arrays.

    ```cpp
    // Declaration with size
    int numbers[5];

    // Declaration with initialization
    int scores[] = {85, 90, 78, 92, 88};
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>

    In Java, we declare the array type using brackets `[]`.

    ```java
    // Declaration
    int[] numbers;

    // Initialization with size
    numbers = new int[5];

    // Declaration and Initialization in one line
    int[] scores = {85, 90, 78, 92, 88};
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>

    Python uses Lists, which are dynamic arrays. They don't require explicit type declaration.

    ```python
    # Empty list
    numbers = []

    # List with initial values
    scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

    # List of specific size (initialized with None or 0)
    zeros = [0] * 5
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>

    JavaScript arrays are also dynamic and can hold mixed types.

    ```javascript
    // Empty array
    let numbers = [];

    // Array with initial values
    let scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88];

    // Array constructor (less common)
    let fixedSize = new Array(5);
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accessing Elements

Once declared, you can access elements using their index. Remember that array indexing typically starts at **0**.

<Callout type="warning">
    Attempting to access an index outside the bounds of the array (e.g., index 5
    in an array of size 5) will result in an error or undefined behavior
    depending on the language.
</Callout>

```cpp
int scores[] = {85, 90, 78, 92, 88};

// Accessing the first element
int firstScore = scores[0]; // 85

// Accessing the last element
int lastScore = scores[4]; // 88
```
