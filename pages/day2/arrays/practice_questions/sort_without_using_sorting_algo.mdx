### Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s without using any sorting algorithm

#### Description

-   Given an array `A` of size `N` containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

#### Constraints

-   `1 <= N <= 10^6`
-   `0 <= A[i] <= 2`

#### Code

    ```cpp copy
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    void sort012(int a[], int arr_size) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = arr_size - 1;
        int mid = 0;

        while (mid <= hi) {
            if (`a[mid]` == 0) {
                swap(`a[lo]`, `a[mid]`);
                lo++;
                mid++;
            }
            else if (`a[mid]` == 1) {
                mid++;
            }
            else {
                swap(`a[mid]`, a[hi]);
                hi--;
            }
        }
    }

    int main() {
        int arr[] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1};
        int arr_size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

        sort012(arr, arr_size);

        for (int i = 0; i < arr_size; i++) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        }

        return 0;
    }
    ```

    #### Explanation

    - The `sort012` function sorts the given array a consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single pass.
    - It uses three pointers: `lo` pointing to the last 0 in the sorted region, `hi` pointing to the first 2 in the sorted region, and `mid` traversing through the array.
    - The function checks the value of `a[mid]` and performs the following operations:
        - If `a[mid]` is 0, it swaps `a[mid]` with `a[lo]`, increments both `lo` and `mid` pointers, and moves the `mid` pointer forward.
        - If `a[mid]` is 1, it simply increments the `mid` pointer.
        - If `a[mid]` is 2, it swaps `a[mid]` with `a[hi]`, decrements the `hi` pointer, and moves the `mid` pointer forward.
    - The main function initializes an array arr with the given elements and determines the size of the array. It then calls the `sort012` function to sort the array.
    - Finally, the sorted array is printed using a `for` loop.

    #### Analysis

    - Time Complexity: `O(N)`
    - Space Complexity: `O(1)`

        lo = 0
        hi = arr_size - 1
        mid = 0
        while mid <= hi:
            # If the element is 0
            if a[mid] == 0:
                a[lo], a[mid] = a[mid], a[lo]
                lo = lo + 1
                mid = mid + 1
            # If the element is 1
            elif a[mid] == 1:
                mid = mid + 1
            # If the element is 2
            else:
                a[mid], a[hi] = a[hi], a[mid]
                hi = hi - 1
        return a

    arr = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
    arr_size = len(arr)
    arr = sort012(arr, arr_size)
    for k in a:
        print(k, end=' ')
    ```

    #### Explanation

    - The function takes an array a and its size arr_size as input.
    - It initializes three pointers lo, mid, and hi to keep track of the positions of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the array.
    - Using a while loop, the function iterates until the mid pointer exceeds the hi pointer.
    - Inside the loop, it checks the value at the mid position:
        - If the value is 0, it swaps the element at the lo position with the element at the mid position. Then, it increments both lo and mid by 1.
        - If the value is 1, it simply increments the mid pointer by 1.
        - If the value is 2, it swaps the element at the mid position with the element at the hi position. Then, it decrements hi by 1.
    - The function continues this process until all 0s, 1s, and 2s are placed in their respective positions.
    - Finally, the function returns the sorted array.
