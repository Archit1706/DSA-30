### Merge Intervals <DifficultyBadge level="medium" />

#### Description

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

#### Examples

```py
> Case 1:
    Input: intervals = [[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
    Explanation: [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge into [1,6].

> Case 2:
    Input: intervals = [[1,4], [4,5]]
    Output: [[1,5]]
    Explanation: [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping (they share endpoint 4).

> Case 3:
    Input: intervals = [[1,4], [0,4]]
    Output: [[0,4]]
```

#### Constraints

-   `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
-   `intervals[i].length == 2`
-   `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4`

#### Approach

1. **Sort** intervals by start time
2. Walk through sorted intervals -- if the current interval overlaps with the previous merged interval, extend it. Otherwise, start a new merged interval.

Two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` overlap if `c <= b` (when sorted by start).

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {

            if (intervals[i][0] <= merged.back()[1]) {
                // Extend the end of the last merged interval

        }

            else:
                # No overlap, add as new interval
                merged.append([start, end])

        return merged

    # Examples
    print(merge_intervals([[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]))
    # [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

    print(merge_intervals([[1,4], [4,5]]))
    # [[1, 5]]

#### Explanation

After sorting by start time, we can process intervals left to right:
- If the current interval's start is `<=` the last merged interval's end, they overlap. We extend the merged interval's end to cover both.
- If there's a gap between them, we know no future intervals can overlap with the previous group (because we're sorted), so we start a new merged interval.

**Visual walkthrough** with `[[1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]]`:
```
After sorting: [1,3], [2,6], [8,10], [15,18]

merged = [[1,3]]

[2,6]: 2 <= 3 (overlap) -> extend to [1,6]
merged = [[1,6]]

[8,10]: 8 > 6 (no overlap) -> add new
merged = [[1,6], [8,10]]

[15,18]: 15 > 10 (no overlap) -> add new
merged = [[1,6], [8,10], [15,18]]
```

<Callout type="info">
    **Sorting is the key.** Without sorting, you'd need to compare every
    interval with every other interval (O(n^2)). Sorting lets us make the
    merge decision in a single left-to-right pass.
</Callout>

#### Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n log n)` -- dominated by the sort
- Space Complexity: `O(n)` -- for the merged result (or O(log n) for the sort itself)
