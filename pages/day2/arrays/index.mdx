# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They serve as the building blocks for many other data structures.

## Ideally, what is an Array?

An array is a collection of items stored at **contiguous memory locations**. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

## The Problem with Variables

Imagine you need to store the marks of 5 students. Simple enough, just create 5 variables:

```cpp
int mark1 = 90;
int mark2 = 85;
int mark3 = 78;
int mark4 = 92;
int mark5 = 88;
```

But what if you need to store the marks for:

- An entire class (50 students)?
- An entire school (1000 students)?
- An entire university (20,000 students)?

Creating 20,000 individual variables is impossible to manage! You can't loop through `mark1`, `mark2`... `mark20000`.

## The Array Solution

This is where **Arrays** come in. An array allows you to store all these values in a single variable structure, accessible by an index.

<Callout type="info">
    Think of an array as a row of lockers in a school hallway. Each locker has a
    unique number (index) and can hold one item (student's marks).
</Callout>

Instead of `mark1`, `mark2`, etc., we have `marks[0]`, `marks[1]`, `marks[2]`, and so on.

<ArrayVisualizer
    initialArray={[90, 85, 78, 92, 88]}
    labels={{ 0: "marks" }}
/>

### Key Characteristics

1.  **Fixed Size:** In many languages (like C and Java), the size of the array must be known at compile time.
2.  **Same Data Type:** You can't store an integer in one slot and a string in another (in strictly typed languages).
3.  **Indexed Access:** You can access any element instantly if you know its index.
4.  **Contiguous Memory:** Elements live next to each other in memory -- this is what makes arrays fast.

## Types of Arrays

### By Dimensions

| Type | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1D Array** | A single row of elements | `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` |
| **2D Array** | A table/matrix of elements | `[[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]` |
| **3D+ Array** | Multi-dimensional grids | Used in image processing, scientific computing |

### By Size Behavior

| Type | Languages | Resizable? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Array** | C, C++ (`int arr[5]`), Java | No -- size fixed at creation |
| **Dynamic Array** | Python (`list`), JavaScript, C++ (`vector`) | Yes -- grows/shrinks as needed |

<Callout type="warning">
    Dynamic arrays aren't magic. When a dynamic array runs out of space, it
    allocates a new, larger block of memory (usually 2x), copies everything
    over, and frees the old block. This resize operation costs O(n), but it
    happens rarely enough that insertions are still O(1) **amortized**.
</Callout>

## Where Are Arrays Used?

Arrays are everywhere. Here are some places you've already used them without realizing:

- **Storing pixel data** -- every image is a 2D array of pixel values
- **Strings** -- in C, a string is just an array of characters ending with `\0`
- **Lookup tables** -- mapping an index to a value in O(1)
- **Stacks and Queues** -- often implemented using arrays under the hood
- **Sorting and Searching** -- almost every algorithm operates on arrays
- **Database records** -- rows of data stored in contiguous blocks

## Try It Yourself

Play with this interactive array. Insert, delete, and search for elements to build intuition for how arrays work:

## Quick Check

<QuizBox
    question="What is the index of the first element in an array?"
    options={["1", "0", "-1", "Depends on the language"]}
    correctIndex={1}
    explanation="In most programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript), array indexing starts at 0. Some languages like Lua and MATLAB start at 1, but 0-based indexing is the standard."

<QuizBox
    question="What does 'contiguous memory' mean for arrays?"
    options={[
        "Elements can be stored anywhere in memory",
        "Elements are stored next to each other in memory",
        "Elements are stored in a linked list format",
        "Each element has a pointer to the next"
    ]}
    correctIndex={1}
    explanation="Contiguous memory means elements are stored side-by-side with no gaps. This is what enables O(1) random access -- the computer can calculate any element's address using: base_address + (index * element_size)."
