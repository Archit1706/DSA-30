# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in computer science. They serve as the building blocks for many other data structures.

## Ideally, what is an Array?

An array is a collection of items stored at **contiguous memory locations**. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

## The Problem with Variables

Imagine you need to store the marks of 5 students. Simple enough, just create 5 variables:

```cpp
int mark1 = 90;
int mark2 = 85;
int mark3 = 78;
int mark4 = 92;
int mark5 = 88;
```

But what if you need to store the marks for:

- An entire class (50 students)?
- An entire school (1000 students)?
- An entire university (20,000 students)?

Creating 20,000 individual variables is impossible to manage! You can't loop through `mark1`, `mark2`... `mark20000`.

## The Array Solution

This is where **Arrays** come in. An array allows you to store all these values in a single variable structure, accessible by an index.

<Callout emoji="💡">
    Think of an array as a row of lockers in a school hallway. Each locker has a
    unique number (index) and can hold one item (student's marks).
</Callout>

Instead of `mark1`, `mark2`, etc., we have `marks[0]`, `marks[1]`, `marks[2]`, and so on.

### Key Characteristics

1.  **Fixed Size:** In many languages (like C and Java), the size of the array must be known at compile time.
2.  **Same Data Type:** You can't store an integer in one slot and a string in another (in strictly typed languages).
3.  **Indexed Access:** You can access any element instantly if you know its index.
