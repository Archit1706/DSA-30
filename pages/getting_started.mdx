# Getting Started 🚀

Welcome to the **DSA-30** challenge! You're about to embark on a journey that will transform your coding skills from "I think I know array" to "I can optimize that graph traversal in my sleep".

## How to use this guide

This isn't your typical textbook. We focus on **patterns**, **visuals**, and **intuitive understanding**.

1.  **Don't Rush**: Each day is designed to be digested fully. Don't skip ahead until you truly _get_ the concept.
2.  **Code Along**: Reading is silver, coding is gold. Open your IDE and type out the examples.
3.  **Visualize It**: Use the GIFs and diagrams. If you can draw it, you can code it.

## Prerequisites

You don't need to be a wizard, but you should know:

- Basic programming syntax (Java is used here, but the logic is universal).
- How to run a "Hello World" program.
- A willingness to debug (because bugs _will_ happen).

## Your Toolkit

- **IDE**: VS Code, IntelliJ, or even Notepad if you're feeling dangerous.
- **Coffee/Tea**: Essential fuel for debugging sessions.
- **Persistence**: The only algorithm that guarantees success.
