### Delete Node in a Singly Linked List

#### Description

There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

-   The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
-   The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
-   All the values before node should be in the same order.
-   All the values after node should be in the same order.

#### Constraints

-   The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
-   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
-   The value of each `node` in the list is **unique**.
-   The `node` to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.

#### Test Cases

-   Input: `head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5` <br />
    Output: `[4,1,9]`

-   Input: `head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1` <br />
    Output: `[4,5,9]`

#### Code

<Steps>

    ##### Approach 1: `Copy and Delete`

    <Tabs items={['C++', 'Python']} defaultIndex="0">
        <Tab>
        ```cpp copy
        void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
            node->val = node->next->val;
            node->next = node->next->next;
        }
        ```

        </Tab>

        <Tab>
        ```python copy
        def deleteNode(node):
            node.val = node.next.val
            node.next = node.next.next
        ```

        </Tab>

        #### Explanation

        1. Copy the value of the next node to the current node.
        2. Delete the next node.
