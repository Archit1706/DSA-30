## Introduction

**DSA-30** is a platform for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in a fun and structured way. To contribute effectively, you should understand how to use templates and components provided in this project.

## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, ensure you have the following set up:

-   Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Templates

### chapter-page.mdx

This template is used to display the main text content to the user on the website for any chapter. You can create new chapters using this template.

### image.mdx

This template is used when you want to display images on the website.

### practice-question.mdx

This template is used when you want to show a question on the website along with code, explanation, and time complexity analysis for various approaches.

## Components

### ShowHideGif.jsx

This component allows you to display GIFs with a toggle for play/pause.

**Usage**:

```jsx copy
import { ShowHideGif } from "../components/ShowHideGif";

<ShowHideGif
    gifUrl="/path/to/your/gif.gif"
    pausedGifUrl="/path/to/your/paused.gif"
/>;
```

### ShowHideSolution.mdx

This component allows you to hide and show solutions to problems.

**Usage**:

```jsx copy
import { ShowHideSolution } from "../components/ShowHideSolution";

<ShowHideSolution>
    Your solution content goes here(mdx format allowed).
</ShowHideSolution>;
```

## Folder Structure

To ensure that Nextra understands and interprets the file structure correctly, each new chapter folder must have a `meta.json` file. The `meta.json` file should have the following structure:

```json copy
{
    "index": "TODO",
    "introduction": "Introduction",
    "practice_questions": "Practice Questions"
}
```

You are free to update this file as needed, but this structure helps Nextra navigate the content properly.
